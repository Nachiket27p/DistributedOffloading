# Task Offloading in Distributed Systems

## Project Abstract
* Heterogeneous distributed systems are more involved when it comes to balancing work loads due to the varying performance level of machines in the network.
* With an increase in the number of mobile devices and more reliable internet connections offloading demanding workloads to more powerful machines in a network can provide performance improvement.
* Tasks can be dynamically or statically offloaded, either whole tasks can be offloaded or parts of a task can be offloaded.
* Several things need to be considered before offloading a task; determine if the task can be offloaded effectively, which machines on the network can accept offloaded tasks, if the overhead of offloading is less than the overhead of waiting to run on the same machines.
* The full proposal: [Proposal]
